# Business Use Cases

The Time-Travel Engine helps any organisation that issues invoices and receives payments later.  
It provides a clear view of what the business looked like on any past date — something standard reporting can’t do.

Below are common scenarios across industries.

---

## 1. Professional Services (Legal, Accounting, Consulting)

These organisations often need to answer:
- “What was still unpaid at the end of last month?”
- “When was this invoice actually paid in full?”
- “What did our outstanding debt look like on the day of the board meeting?”

The engine reconstructs the financial state of every invoice on any date, giving accurate historical views without needing saved snapshots.

---

## 2. Agencies & Creative Firms

Invoices are often:
- issued in stages,
- paid late,
- part-paid,
- or adjusted after month-end.

The engine shows exactly what was owed *at the time*, not what’s owed now.

## 3. Contractors & Field Services

Payments frequently arrive weeks after work is completed.  
The Time-Travel Engine lets managers rewind and see:

- outstanding amounts on a past reporting date  
- payment progress over time  
- true financial closure of each job

---

## 4. Subscription & Retainer Businesses

Where clients pay in instalments, it helps answer:
- “How much had been collected by that date?”
- “How much was still due?”
- “Which accounts were behind at that point?”

---

## 5. Any business that reconciles month-end manually

Typical pain points:
- late postings
- corrections made after month-end
- spreadsheets used to rebuild old numbers

The Time-Travel Engine eliminates all manual reconstruction by recalculating everything as of the selected date.
